# X16-Simple-Intf

This is a proof of concept interface between the X16's 6502 bus and a modern microcontroller. This could be done much more simply with a CPLD, but in keeping with the "retro feel" of the X16, this was implement using all 74xx logic in a DIP package.

Note: The X16 card edge in the design may be mirrored. Until this can be validated, use at your own risk!
